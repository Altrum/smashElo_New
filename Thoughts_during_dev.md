- UI takes a long time, but its really fun
- Learning everything by myself is sometimes really frustrating and discouraging
- Database stuff is really difficult... Maybe it's because it's my first time.
- Still don't know how to use FirebaseUI github extension thing
    - I'll include it for now
- I really don't know what I'm doing.
- I want to understand best practices but I have a feeling I'm just brute forcing some things
- Time flies when I work on this.  A lot of research and trial/error process
- Decided to let go of UI until I make the app work
- Last decision actually made development process a lot faster.  Glad I made this choice.
- I just want to finish this app...
- Git is still super unfamiliar to me and I really got frustrated when moving files or managing files with git -- Especially when I was moving computers
- I realized I focused on things that I didn't need to worry about until further in the dev process in the beginning.
- Lots of changes and modifications from the original idea as I worked on it
- Whiteboards are pretty sick
- Database management was relatively hard to think about
    - Are search operations on Databases efficient?
        - I feel like the methods I use or will use aren't going to be scalabe for huge crowds
- So many questions!! Trying to find IOS developers at my school but getting no luck... :(
    - If only my professor did IOS and not Android
- Swift seems like a neat language so far.
- Oh, facebook integration took some time. I was REALLY happy when I finally got it to work.
- Pushing, presenting, and transitioning view controllers was the for some reason so difficult in the beginning
    - I think it was because I didn't understand the Navigation hierarchy and stuff
- Database listeners -- still figuring out what it exactly it is.
- Then again, I'm trying to figure out everything and what it is lol
    - I think I got a hang of some of the stuff, as long as I'm doing it right (fingers crossed)
