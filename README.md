Fun app for keeping track of elo in ssb4


An App to keep track of who's better at SSB4.

A project for me to learn swift, xcode, and mobile development

UPDATE: Here is how it works -- or should work. I've played around with different ideas of what the best practice would be so that it would work both local and "online."

- You log in or create a user with facebook or email
- You are directed to a Matches view where you can see your active matches or basically a "tournament ground"
- You can add matches by creating a new match or joining one by inputting a code that corresponds to other matches other people made
- Within matches, you will have rankings and can look at everyone's stats.
- You have a local elo within that match where everyone starts at a default elo, and you also have your own elo that you have outside these specific match fields.  This self-specific elo is an "estimated" elo of what you should be.  This gets updated every game you play -- since you will be facing against the opponent who also has their own global elo
- I didn't want to make a global ranking because it is too easy to abuse. I'm sure if this does get users some will abuse anyways, but I thought a global ranking would be just too much of an incentive to cheat. I'm sure some will do it anyways to show off but not much I can do for now.
- Uses Firebase
- If you want to see my thoughts throughout the process I also have another text document recording such.

Thanks and happy Smashing!
